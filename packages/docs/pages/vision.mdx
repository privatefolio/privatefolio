# Vision

Privatefolio was born out of necessity, after growing frustrated with the limitations of existing investment portfolio trackers.

SaaS products offer great user experience & analytics, but you cannot extend these apps. The only thing you can do is to "upvote the next broker to be supported".

There are open-source alternatives, but they do not come close to their SaaS counterparts in terms of UX.

**What if we could change that?** What if we could do for investing and personal finance what WordPress did for blogging?

# Meet Privatefolio [The AI Wealth Manager - A free* and open-source toolkit for financial empowerment]

**Privatefolio is a tool you own**. It allows you to collect, analyze and visualize your financial data.

You can use it in conjunction with LLMs and AI agents to gain a deeper understanding of where you are at, and to plan for the future.

Privatefolio is for: 1) Investment portfolios, 2) Accounting, 3) Tax reporting & planning, 4) Financial intelligence, 5) Privacy, 6) AI workflows, 7) Expense tracking, 8) Budgeting, 9) Cashflow predictions, 10) Retirement planning, 11) FIRE, 12) Volatility simulations, 13) Risk management and much more.

Due to its open-source nature and its *GNU AGPL-3.0* license, it has the necessary properties to be used as an operating system for one's finances (individual or business).
This is achievable if we create a thriving ecosystem of extensions (paid and free), just like WordPress has.
