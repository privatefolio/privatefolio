# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is Privatefolio really free?

Yes! Privatefolio is completely free to use, free to modify and free to distribute, its source code is available under the **GNU AGPL-3.0** license.

However, since Privatefolio is extensible, just like in App Store or Google Play, you may encounter extensions that require a one-time fee or a paid subscription.

## Can I self-host Privatefolio?

Yes! The easiest way to self-host is to either install any of the [desktop apps](https://privatefolio.xyz/downloads) on your computer, or to [run the Docker image](./self-hosting-with-docker) on your server.

## Can I contribute to the project?

Absolutely! Open-source and collaboration are at the core of our mission. You can develop custom extensions and earn money doing so.

Extensions can range from support for new csv formats, new price providers, advanced analytics, AI features (like voice, or deep research agents) and much more.

You can provide suggestions on how we can improve the app, or help with documentation. Check out our [developer quickstart on Github](https://github.com/privatefolio/privatefolio?tab=readme-ov-file#for-developers) and make sure to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YHHu9nK8VD).

## Is there a premium plan?

Yes! The app is free, but we offer a premium plan that includes a faster cloud machine, higher AI limits and priority support. This helps us maintain and improve the project.

## Is Privatefolio like WordPress?

Exactly! Like WordPress, Privatefolio is open-source, self-hostable, and highly extensible. Anyone can develop extensions (i.e. plugins) to add new features. Similarly to WordPress's business model, we offer a premium plan that includes a faster cloud machine, higher AI limits and priority support.

## What is the AGPL-3.0 license?

The AGPL-3.0 (GNU Affero General Public License) is a strong copyleft license that ensures the software remains free and open. Here are the key freedoms it provides:

- **Freedom to Use**: You can use the software for any purpose, including commercial use.
- **Freedom to Study and Modify**: You can study how the program works and modify it to suit your needs, including for commercial purposes.
- **Freedom to Distribute Copies**: You can redistribute copies of the original program.
- **Freedom to Distribute Modified Versions**: You are allowed to distribute your modified versions, including for profit. However, if you run a modified version of the software on a server and allow others to interact with it, you must provide the source code of the modified version to those users.

This helps maintain the open ecosystem while allowing commercial use through our premium offerings.
