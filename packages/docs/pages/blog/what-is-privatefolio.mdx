# What is Privatefolio? [The Free\* and Open-source Portfolio Tracker — All your crypto assets in one place]

![Blog post cover](https://paragraph.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F7de6f9ee678322de019bebee54ce0f03.jpg&w=1080&q=75)

Privatefolio lets you track your assets across blockchains and exchanges.

Import your data and let the app do the rest — calculate your historical net worth, profits, losses, taxes and more.

## How?

Privatefolio is a local-first app, there is no server your data needs to travel to; it all happens right in your browser.

It leverages three kinds of public APIs:

1. APIs for asset prices: Binance, Coinbase & DeFi-Llama — Redstone, Pyth coming soon.
2. APIs for asset metadata: Coingecko (such as logo images, websites, descriptions).
3. APIs for user data: Etherscan, Binance Account API.

It also makes use of [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org), which allows for high amounts of data to be stored in the browser. How much? Chrome and Chromium-based browsers allow up to 80% of disk space, i.e. on a 500 GB laptop a web app can use a maximum of 400 GB.

## Does it scale?

Using public APIs can be challenging; for example Coingecko’s stingy free tier. Nonetheless, with the use of a local cache (which works ok for metadata) we can get good user experience.

Fetching historical asset prices using Coinbase & Binance scales even if you have transacted hundreds of assets — for example, if you fetch the daily candles of 100 assets for the past 6 years within the same minute, you would only use 10% of Binance’s rate limit.

Fetching user data using Etherscan works great even for users with millions of transactions. Their public API allows up to 5 calls per second and 1 call can retrieve up to 10,000 records. Binance on the other hand is quite limiting and syncing an account can take many hours, but this is a challenge shared by all the portfolio trackers on the market.

Read more about rate limits on [GitHub](https://github.com).

The answer is yes.

## Why?

Back in November 2023 I was looking for other options beyond [delta.app](https://delta.app) to use as a portfolio tracker, because:

1. I have to check 3 different apps to get an overview of my assets.
2. Delta reports my Binance balances inaccurately (it ignores Futures data).
3. I cannot create a pull request and extend Delta.
4. Other open-source alternatives like [rotki.com](https://rotki.com) lack good UI/UX.

In October 2023, the TradingView team released a plugin system for their amazing open-source charting library called [lightweight-charts](https://github.com), and this library is what powers Privatefolio today and what made features like measuring an arbitrary net worth change possible:

## What’s next?

If there is enough interest from people to use this product I will continue hacking on it.

You can reach out via email at **[hello@danielconstantin.net](mailto:hello@danielconstantin.net)**, start a discussion on [Discord](https://paragraph.xyz), or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com).

Please share any positive feedback, negative feedback, thoughts or ideas.

## Consider donating through Gitcoin

Privatefolio is participating in **GG20**. Donations will be matched using a quadratic funding mechanism, hence, small donations can have a big impact.

GG20 takes place from **April 26 - May 7, 2024**.
