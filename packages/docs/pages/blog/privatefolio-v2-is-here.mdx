# Privatefolio v2 is here!

I’m happy to announce that Privatefolio v2 is available as a public beta. This release is a meaningful step towards achieving a local-first and privacy focused portfolio manager that is on par with popular SaaS alternatives.

## What’s new?

* Desktop apps – they are [available to download](https://privatefolio.xyz/downloads) for Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can install it and let it run in the background – no need to keep a browser tab open anymore.  
* Cloud service – PrivateCloud™️ offers a free & [premium tier](https://privatefolio.xyz/pricing) and it's ideal for users that wish to access the app from their smartphone or do not wish to use the desktop apps.  
* Self-hosting – for the self sovereign individual, deploying a self-hosted instance of Privatefolio can be done in \<5 minutes, using Docker. Make use of the extensive [documentation](https://github.com/privatefolio/privatefolio/blob/main/docs/DOCKER_DEPLOY.md) in our GitHub repository and make sure to read the [fly.io](https://fly.io) deployment example.  
* SQL – the core of Privatefolio has changed, while you can still access v1 which is powered by PouchDB, a no-sql database available in the browser, in v2 we leverage the very familiar SQL language with its most popular implementation: SQLite. Developers and power users can make use of it in building powerful analytics for investment portfolios.  
* Trades – a new primitive. Alongside audit logs and transactions, users can now inspect all their historical trades, including data like cost basis and profit & loss.  
* Time travel – inspect your portfolio and your trades at any given time in the past. [See it on the live demo](https://1.privatefolio.app/l/0/?tab=pnl) (don't forget to select the Inspect cursor in the chart toolbar).  
* Pro chart – did you ever want to use indicators and drawing tools on your own data? [Now you can](https://1.privatefolio.app/l/0/pro-chart).  
* Extensions – the best time to extend Privatefolio is now! [Extensions have their own page](https://1.privatefolio.app/l/0/extensions), clear documentation, and plenty of examples. Developers are invited to create & publish their own extensions and earn a share of the revenue (from the cloud subscriptions). In the future they will be able to sell extensions to other users for a flat fee or a recurring subscription.

## We ❤️ open-source and privacy

Privatefolio is built for developers! From the choice of license to the choice of technologies. You can think of it as a Wordpress-like platform.
