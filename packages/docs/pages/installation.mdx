On Mac, download the dmg for your platform and run the installer.

<Callout type="info">
  Privatefolio Desktop is a full standalone app with a built-in backend server, it has everything you need.

<Callout type="note">
  Using the PrivateCloudâ„¢ service is completely optional, but useful: for example using Privatefolio on mobile devices which 1) cannot run the backend module at the moment and 2) can run into battery restrictions leading to poor UX.
