description: Deploy Privatefolio frontend to web hosting platforms like Cloudflare Pages
---

Deploying Privatefolio on the web involves hosting the build output of the `@privatefolio/frontend` package.

:::note
  Just like Privatefolio v1, in the future, you will be able to run the `@privatefolio/backend` package inside the browser using web workers. Web deployments will then encompass both. Help us make it a reality with 
  [#27](https://github.com/privatefolio/privatefolio/issues/27).

## Build

Once you setup the project and [its prerequisites](/developers/getting-started), you can build the frontend.

```bash title=""
yarn build 
# output dir: packages/frontend/build
```

## Deploy

### with `serve`

```bash
npx serve -p 8080 -C packages/frontend/build
```

### with Cloudflare Pages

```bash
yarn wrangler pages deploy packages/frontend/build --project-name=privatefolio
```

## Official deployment

We are currently deploying to Cloudflare Pages through a GitHub Actions workflow.
This deployment system provides continuous deployment for all branches and pull requests, with Discord notifications for deployment status updates.

  Unlike other production deployments, the latest web deployment corresponds to the latest commit on the `main` branch, not the latest tagged release.
